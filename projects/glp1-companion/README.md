# GLP-1 Companion Project

This repository hosts the first project inside the Commerce Factory. Agents collaborate through `.mail/` threads while humans approve major gates via pull requests.

## Directory Layout

```
.mail/
  inbox/   # Incoming work for agents
  outbox/  # Agent responses awaiting review
skills/    # Shared prompts, tools, and scripts (coming soon)
docs/      # Project-specific references
```

The starter inbox thread `glp1-companion__architect.md` outlines the kickoff brief for this sprint.

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment or Node workspace as required by the tasks in the mail threads.
2. Claim a file lease before editing shared assets.
3. Submit all changes through pull requests for human approval.
